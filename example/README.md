# Example for bloc_state_gen

This Flutter project demonstrates the usage of the `bloc_state_gen` package, which provides state extensions for BLoC patterns.

## Overview

The `bloc_state_gen` package helps generate extensions for BLoC state classes, making it easier to manage state-specific actions such as UI rendering or state transitions.

This example illustrates:
- Defining state classes and annotating them with `@BlocStateGen`.
- Using the generated extensions in your Flutter app.
